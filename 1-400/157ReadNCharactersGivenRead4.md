[用read4() API读取N个字符-单次调用](https://leetcode.com/problems/read-n-characters-given-read4/description/)

```
The API: int read4(char *buf) reads 4 characters at a time from a file.

The return value is the actual number of characters read. For example, it returns 3 if there is only 3 characters left in the file.

By using the read4 API, implement the function int read(char *buf, int n) that reads n characters from the file.

Note:
The read function will only be called once for each test case.
```


```java
/* The read4 API is defined in the parent class Reader4.
      int read4(char[] buf); */

public class Solution extends Reader4 {
    /**
     * @param buf Destination buffer
     * @param n   Maximum number of characters to read
     * @return    The number of characters read
     */
    
    public int read(char[] buf, int n) {
        char[] temp = new char[4];
        int index = 0;
        
        while (true) {
            int count = read4(temp);
            count = Math.min(count, n - index);
            for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
                buf[index++] = temp[i];
            }
            if (index == n || count < 4) {
                return index;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
