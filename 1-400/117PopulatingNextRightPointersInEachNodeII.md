Follow up for problem "Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node".

What if the given tree could be any binary tree? Would your previous solution still work?

Note:

You may only use constant extra space.
For example,
Given the following binary tree,
         1
       /  \
      2    3
     / \    \
    4   5    7
After calling your function, the tree should look like:
         1 -> NULL
       /  \
      2 -> 3 -> NULL
     / \    \
    4-> 5 -> 7 -> NULL
```

```java
public class Solution {
    public void connect(TreeLinkNode root) {
        TreeLinkNode head = null; //head of the next level
        TreeLinkNode prev = null; //the leading node on the next level
        TreeLinkNode cur = root;  //current node of current level

        while (cur != null) {   
            while (cur != null) { //iterate on the current level
                //left child
                if (cur.left != null) {
                    if (prev != null) {
                        prev.next = cur.left;
                    } else {
                        head = cur.left;
                    }
                    prev = cur.left;
                }
                //right child
                if (cur.right != null) {
                    if (prev != null) {
                        prev.next = cur.right;
                    } else {
                        head = cur.right;
                    }
                    prev = cur.right;
                }
                //move to next node
                cur = cur.next;
            }
            
            //move to next level
            cur = head;
            head = null;
            prev = null;
        }
    }
}
